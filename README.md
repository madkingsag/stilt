# Stilt

*Elegant Node API Framework.*

## What is this

*warning*: Stilt is a work in progress. Until semver release 1.0.0, we recommend not using it in production.

Stilt can help you build REST & GraphQL APIs using pure JavaScript (and decorators).

Stilt doesn't do much by itself, you will need to read the documentation on one of its packages to learn more on what Stilt can do:

- [@stilt/core](packages/core/README.md) for details on dependency injection
- [@stilt/rest](packages/rest/README.md) if you are interested in building a REST API
- [@stilt/graphql](packages/graphql/README.md) if you are interested in building a GraphQL API
- [@stilt/squelize](packages/sequelize/README.md) for sequelize support
- [@stilt/jwt-sessions](packages/jwt-sessions/README.md) to get access to jwt-based sessions.
